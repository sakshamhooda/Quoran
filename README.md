Major area of study has been closed book as well as augumented Question Answering, along with various other NLP tasks like topic modelling, semantic analysis, seiamese network implementation.

  Various methodologies have been deployed in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase to extract out important insights from dataset.

  A further work is under pipeline to check how usage of frameworks like RAG, finetuning-decomposition using LoRA and that of quantisation of NLP tasks.
